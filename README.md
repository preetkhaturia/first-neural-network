# Your First Neural Network

This project runs in Python on a Jupyter Notebook. It is a 2-layer neural network that predicts ridership patterns of a bike-sharing service, based on a given data set input. Overall, this network takes in three input features and implements forward propagation using a sigmoid activation function in the 2-node hidden layer. The network then calculates the error and performs backpropagation to update the both the hidden-to-output and input-to-hidden weights.

This neural network was implemented as the first project in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
